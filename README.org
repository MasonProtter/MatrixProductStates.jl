* MatrixProductStates.jl

This is a package-in-progress in which I intend to implement a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group][DMRG]]
algorithm over matrix product states as explained in Schollw√∂ck's [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491610001752][The
density-matrix renormalization group in the age of matrix product
states]]. This same project has been undertaken in [[https://github.com/0/LatticeSweeper.jl][LatticeSweeper.jl]].
